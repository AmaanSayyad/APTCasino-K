## APTCasino-Kiichain

### Inspiration
One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of [https://stake.com/](url) which was giving 200% bonus on first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Play Plinko Online - Pachinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limit which said that if he wants to withdraw the deposited amount then he have to play $12,300 worth of game play and this was the big shock for him where he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back he played the game Plinko entire night and lost all money.

He was very annoyed of this and that's how APT-Casino born, which is a combination of ai, gamefi and defi all in one platform where new web3 users can play games, perform gambling but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming platforms.

### Problem
The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:
- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** Many platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.

- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.

- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.

- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.

- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.

### Solution
 APT-Casino addresses these problems by offering:
- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilizing the Kiichain to ensure all game outcomes are transparent and verifiably fair.



- **Low Fees:** Leveraging the efficiency of Kiichain to minimize transaction costs.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users with unrestricted access to their funds.

- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and Clean bonus terms without hidden traps.

- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralized asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

### Key Features
**APT-Casino** offers a multifaceted platform with three main features:

**1. AI - Social Aspect:**
- Users create **AI-generated NFT profile pictures**based on keywords.
- View a **community leaderboard**.
- Explore other **players' profiles, recent activity, and ENS**.

**2. GameFi - Gaming Aspect:**
- **APT-Casino** includes a fully functional **European roulette game**.
- Users can place various types of bets such as **straight, split, street, corner, six line, column, dozen, red, black, high, low, even, and odd.**
- The **roulette wheel** randomly generates winning values.**
- Winnings are automatically calculated and transferred to the users wallet on Kiichain.

**3. Defi - Lending Aspect:**
- Users can **deposit kii tokens as collateral to borrow in game currency that is APTC** such that if the users holding is in kii and if kii goes up by 10% then the value of the collateral goes up by 10% and users can enjoy playing games/ gambling without facing any financial losses as the in game currency(APTC) is stable and has nothing to deal with collateral.
- Facilitates gameplay without the need to sell existing holdings.
- Ensures players have the necessary assets to participate in games seamlessly using for real-time asset prices.

**Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of fully on-chain games, including roulette, mines, wheel of luck, blackjack, plinko, and more. As a (POC) Proof of Concept we developed fully on-chain Roulette but similar model can be applied to introduce the new casino games to the platform.



### What's next

- Bringing in new monetization schema's to compensate the casino games/ game creators.

- Having a in-built live streaming, for gameplay we may utilize livepeer/ lens/ huddle01 for this feature and allow players to do streaming within the application.
